# I Dunno Cafe: The 'dinner spinner'

Have you ever tried deciding where to eat with your significant other? Of course you have. Everyone has. This application was inspired by the daunting task of trying to pick a place of where to eat, because we all know, relationships are just two people trying to decide where to eat until one of them dies.

## Planning Story

This app was inspired by my wonderful fiance whom I love and have infinite patience for. Getting her to decide on what she wants to eat is not like pulling teeth or anything. So we came up with this idea of generating a random place to eat from inputting the restaurants we want to eat from and randomizing them. The final product was supposed to push the names of the restaurants to a wheel and be able to spin the wheel to get the random selection, but that is still a work in progress.

### User Stories

- As a user I want to sign in/up

- As a user I want to Read multiple restaurants
- As a user I want to Read a single restaurant
- As a user I want to Update a restaurant that I own
- As a user I want to Delete a restaurant I own
- As a user I want to read a random restaurant

### Technologies Used

- jQuery

### Unsolved Problems

- Would like to eventually add the spinner to the application.
